# Google-Black-Theme
It's a theme to make your Google white screen turn black while working in low lights in order to protect eyes. It contains a __JSON__ file (_Manifest.json_) and a __CSS__ file (_google-dark-mode.css_). The __JSON__ file checks the site and calls upon the attributes while the __CSS__ file contains the attributes (_Black Mode_).
